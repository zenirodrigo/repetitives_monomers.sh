Using assembled genomes, it isolates complete units of tandem repetitive sequences, such as multigene families and satellite DNAs, outputting a .blast file with the characteristics of each sequence and a fasta file with these isolated monomers.

First input = genome assembled in .fasta format
Second input = a reference sequence to blast in the first input
Fist output = A .blast file containing reference sequence data on each chromosome presented by the assembled genome
Second output = A .fasta file containing all the monomers of the reference sequence with 10,000bp or less (can be change in the code) found in the assembled genoma
